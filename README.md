## 🧠 From Storytelling to Syntax — Navigating the Future of AI

Still a n00b in the GitHub world — apologies in advance for any quirks. I’m only human!

I started my “career” in creative writing at age 15, writing for the Finnish rock magazine *Rumba*. Since then, I’ve expanded into other Finnish publications as well as musical adventures in hard rock, death metal, and hardcore punk.

In recent years, as journalism got swallowed up by influencers, clickbait, and algorithm-friendly mediocrity, I found that honest, gritty writing was less appreciated — and so one by one I lost my income sources. Along the way, I also struggled with alcohol, which swallowed a lot of my time, spirit, and soul — until I found something way more interesting to concentrate on again. Fortunately.

So I am still here. Alive and kicking. Rebuilding. Starting over from scratch at 51 — just like at 15.  
(Just numbers flipped around, eh?)

## ⚡ The Tech ­Shift (With Help From AI)

I asked ChatGPT to describe my current journey, and this is what she came up with:

> *"I'm a creative communicator turned AI-driven problem solver based in Finland. With a solid background in journalism, editing, and cultural commentary, I’ve recently pivoted into the world of technology — learning to build with code and create with large language models."*

She got it mostly right — though I’d say I started pivoting into tech already back in the mid-80s with my Aquarius and Commodore 64. I wasn’t coding back then, just gaming like crazy. AH, the joy!

It’s only recently that I’ve discovered a term I can **fully relate to**:  
🌀 **VIBE CODING** – Code presented and provided to me by AI & LLM's – but where I am its spirit, soul and mind-mapper.

Thanks to AI tools and LLMs, I can now experiment and explore through **creativity, errors, and curiosity**.

In Spring 2024, I took part in the 01-edu Piscine on Åland Islands and was accepted into the Grit:lab full-stack dev program. I studied Golang there until April 2025, when a theory checkpoint tripped me up and cut my study path right there.

Still, I gained the mindset, the tools, and the fire to keep going on my own path. So, here I am.
